Introduction to loops, list, dictionaries sets and tuples
* Loops are defined as lists of lists 
* Lists are mutable, can contain different types of data
* Dictionaries are mutable, can contain key-value pairs
* Sets are mutable, can contain unique elements
* Tuples are immutable, can contain different types of data

***Steps***
1. Create a list of numbers
2. Use a for loop to iterate through the list and print each number


"""
numbers= [20,30, 40 ,50, 6, 7]
# info = ["dabel","2",34,9,0 ,True,]
# print(numbers[-1])
for i in range(numbers.length):
    print(numbers[i])
